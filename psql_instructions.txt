Instructions for creating a new postgresql database.

-First open postgres as superuser:
sudo su - postgres

-Enter the psql:
psql

-Create a new DATABASE (the database must have the same name that the database in the settings.py file in django):
CREATE DATABASE crmdatabase;

-Now create a new user (same as the database, new user and password must be the same as settings.py file):
CREATE USER gt1 WITH PASSWORD 'admin';    (the password must be put between ' ')

-Now we change default roles a little bit...:
ALTER ROLE gt1 SET client_encoding TO 'utf8';
ALTER ROLE gt1 SET default_transaction_isolation TO 'read committed';
ALTER ROLE gt1 SET timezone TO 'UTC';
ALTER ROLE gt1 CREATEDB;

-Finally, we grant all privileges to our user over the database:
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE crmdatabase TO gt1;

-Exit the command lines:
\q
exit


-Oh, if you have crazy problems with the database... DROP IT:

sudo su - postgres

dropdb crmdatabase

psql

CREATE DATABASE crmdatabase;

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE crmdatabase TO gt1;

\q
exit
